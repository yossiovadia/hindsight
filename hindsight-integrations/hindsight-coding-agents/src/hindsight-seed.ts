/**
 * hindsight-seed — MANUAL control command (escape hatch): `seed` forces a background backfill of a
 * repo's bank now; `decline` opts a repo out of auto-seeding. Normal seeding is automatic and
 * deterministic via the Claude SessionStart hook (core/session-start.ts) — this CLI is not part of
 * that automatic path; it's for forcing/opting-out by hand.
 *
 * Claude-Code-only for now: the harness is hardcoded to "claude-code" below, since this CLI is only
 * ever invoked from the Claude Code SessionStart flow (Task 10b). If it's ever driven from another
 * harness's context — especially one with a non-default `bankIdTemplate` or a `harnesses.<name>`
 * override in the config — the hardcoded harness would resolve the wrong bank. Generalizing would
 * need a real `--harness` flag, not added here.
