/**
 * Shared diagnostics helper for hook-based harnesses (Claude Code, Cursor CLI, ...): appends a
 * JSON line to the diagnostic file so a silently memory-less session can't masquerade as one that
 * worked. Never throws — diagnostics must not break the agent.
 *
 * Deliberately neutral (no dependency on recall/reflect or retain specifics) so every lifecycle
 * hook (UserPromptSubmit, Stop, and future ones like SessionStart) can depend on it without
 * reaching into another hook's module.
