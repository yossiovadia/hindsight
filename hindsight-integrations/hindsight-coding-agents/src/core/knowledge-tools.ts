/**
 * Knowledge-page MCP tool specs — SDK-free so this stays unit-testable without a real MCP host.
 *
 * `src/mcp-server.ts` is the only file that imports the MCP SDK; it wires the specs returned here
 * into an `McpServer`. Each tool wraps one `HindsightClient` knowledge-page/recall method: it never
 * throws — a thrown client error is caught and turned into an `isError:true` text result so the
 * calling LLM sees the failure instead of the process crashing.
 *
 * The agent-facing surface is intentionally curated: grounding + capture only. Raw page CRUD
 * (create/update/delete) is deliberately NOT exposed — agents never author page structure; they
 * capture initiatives (`hindsight_capture_initiative`) and pages are synthesized/maintained by the
 * server. `hindsight_ingest_document` (raw-content retain) also backs the codebase survey
 * (core/survey.ts).
