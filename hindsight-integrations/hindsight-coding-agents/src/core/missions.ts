  "(functions, methods, files) and behaviors it changes. Preserve exact identifiers, paths, and " +
  "literal values verbatim. Preserve the 'REF-ID: <token>' marker verbatim in every fact. Capture " +
  "both WHAT changed and WHY.";

export const GITLOG_MISSION =
  "You are ingesting an aggregated block of git commit MESSAGES ONLY (no diffs) — the project's " +
  "recent commit-message history, newest first. Extract the project's INITIATIVES, FEATURES, " +
  "ENHANCEMENTS, and notable changes or THEMES over time — what the project has been working on and " +
  "how it has evolved. Do NOT extract per-line code detail (there is no diff to draw it from). Group " +
  "related commits into a coherent initiative/theme where the messages make that clear; preserve exact " +
  "identifiers and literal values verbatim when quoting a subject line.";

  "decision chat or a LONG working session — scale the facts to the substance, never to the message " +
  "count. Extract the FEWEST facts that capture the OUTCOME: the settled DECISIONS and their exact " +
  "rules/values (quote literals VERBATIM); concrete CHANGES to specific code entities; problems and " +
  "how they were resolved; conventions or invariants established; at most one fact for a notable " +
  "REJECTED alternative ('initially proposed X, changed to Y because Z'). A short decision chat " +
  "usually yields 1-2 facts; a substantial working session several. CRITICAL: a conversation REVISES " +
  "itself — record ONLY the FINAL state as what is in effect; a superseded proposal appears ONLY " +
  "inside the rejected fact, NEVER as its own 'decided' fact; if the same setting changes several " +
  "times keep only the LAST, and make unmistakably clear which choice WON. Do NOT emit one fact per " +

  "and the LITERAL values, identifiers, strings, numbers, or set members that were decided — quote " +
