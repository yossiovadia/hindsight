"""Background maintenance loop.

A single periodic loop that drives all of Hindsight's recurring housekeeping
from one place, so we don't spawn a separate ``asyncio`` task per concern:

- **Retention sweeps** (hourly): delete ``audit_log`` and ``llm_requests`` rows
  older than their configured retention, across *all* tenant schemas.
- **Consolidation reconcile** (configurable, default 5 min): re-schedule
  consolidation for banks that have eligible-but-unscheduled facts and no
  in-flight consolidation. This recovers facts that were stranded when a
  consolidation operation failed terminally and left them with
  ``consolidated_at IS NULL AND consolidation_failed_at IS NULL`` and nothing to
  re-trigger them.
- **Scheduled mental model refresh** (configurable check cadence, default 60s):
  refresh mental models whose ``trigger.refresh_cron`` schedule is due, but only
  when the model is stale (new memories in its scope since its last refresh), so
  a scheduled tick never burns an LLM call to regenerate identical content. The
  per-model schedule lives in the cron expression; this loop only decides when to
  *check*.

The loop wakes on a short fixed tick and runs each job when its own
``last_run + interval`` is due (run-at-start, then on interval), so adding jobs
with different cadences doesn't burst CPU. Cross-tenant discovery goes through
server-side PL/pgSQL routines (``schemas_with_expired_rows`` and
``banks_needing_consolidation``, in the configured schema — see ``fq_routine``) —
one round-trip each — instead of a per-schema query storm, which matters at
thousands of tenants.
