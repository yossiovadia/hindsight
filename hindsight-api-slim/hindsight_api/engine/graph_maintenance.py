"""Async graph maintenance after document/unit deletes.

Three reconciliation passes run together on every worker invocation:

1. **Relink top-up.** Drain ``graph_maintenance_queue`` (units whose
   outgoing temporal/semantic links lost a neighbour to a delete). For
   each, count current outgoing links per type; if below cap, run the
   same probes retain uses and insert the missing links.

2. **Orphan entity prune.** Delete ``entities`` rows in the bank that no
   longer have any live memory references. FK ON DELETE CASCADE on
   ``entity_cooccurrences`` then removes any cooccurrence row pointing
   at the pruned entities.

3. **Stale cooccurrence prune.** Defensive sweep for cooccurrence rows
   where both endpoints still exist but no current memory references
   both of them — the cooccurrence was real at the time it was recorded,
   but every unit that witnessed it has since been deleted.

Each pass is work the *memories store* owns, because each is a query over
`memory_links`, `unit_entities` and `entities` — the slice the store carves
out. This module orchestrates them (drain the queue, wrap the sweep in a
deadlock-retry) and asks the store to do the part that touches storage. A store
whose links travel inside its memories has no `memory_links` to dangle and no
join table to sweep, so its relink and cooccurrence passes are no-ops and the
job simply prunes the orphan `entities` rows, which stay in Postgres regardless.

The worker dedupes on bank: a second job for the same bank is dropped
while one is pending. Once processing starts, a new job becomes the
*next* pending slot — so work enqueued during processing gets picked up
by the follow-up run.

    Must run inside the same transaction that drops those links, *before* the
    delete (or cascade) fires — once the rows are gone, the join that finds the
    victims returns nothing.

    ``include_affected_units`` covers the case where the affected units are NOT
    being removed: an edit deletes every link incident to the edited unit but
    leaves it live, so the unit needs its own outgoing adjacency rebuilt too.
    Passing it for a unit that will be gone at commit is harmless but pointless
    — the drain skips queue rows with no live unit — so callers should only set
    it when the unit survives the transaction.

    Delegated to the memories store: finding the victims is a `memory_links`
    query, and a store whose links are inline has none, so it returns 0 and the
    relink pass has nothing to do. ``ops`` is accepted for callers that still pass
    it and ignored by a store that resolves what it needs from ``conn``.

    Args:
        conn: Database connection inside the active transaction.
        bank_id: Bank owning the affected units.
        affected_unit_ids: Memory_unit IDs whose incident temporal/semantic
            links are about to be (or are being) removed.
        ops: ``DataAccessOps`` instance, supplies the dialect-specific
            bulk-insert path.
        include_affected_units: Also enqueue ``affected_unit_ids`` themselves,
            for callers that leave them live.
