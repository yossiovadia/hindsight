"""Graph-shaped reads and the link-maintenance passes, in SQL.

Everything here is a query over the *joins* around `memory_units` rather than
over the memories themselves: `unit_entities` (which entities a memory mentions)
and `memory_links` (memory-to-memory temporal/semantic/causal edges).

Two groups of callers:

* **The graph view.** :func:`graph_units`, :func:`graph_entity_rows` and
  :func:`graph_direct_links` return raw rows; the engine still owns the
  filtering, the observation inheritance, the derived entity edges, the
  colouring and the response assembly. These functions answer only "which
  memories", "which entity postings" and "which stored edges".
* **The graph-maintenance job.** :func:`enqueue_relink_victims` runs inside the
  delete transaction; :func:`relink_pass`, :func:`prune_orphan_entities` and
  :func:`prune_stale_cooccurrences` are the three reconciliation passes the job
  drives. The job keeps the orchestration (pass ordering, the deadlock retry
  around the sweeps, the timing log); each function here does the pass's work.

:func:`entity_memory_counts` and :func:`entities_for_units` are the two entity
postings reads that are not part of the graph view but read the same join table.

A store whose links travel inside the memory has nothing to relink and no join
table to sweep, which is why these are methods on the interface at all: it
answers them with zeroes rather than with SQL.
