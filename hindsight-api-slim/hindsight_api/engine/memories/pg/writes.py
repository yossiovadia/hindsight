"""Writes against `memory_units`: the fact insert, the deletes, and observation invalidation.

Everything here mutates the memories slice and nothing else. The document row,
the chunks, the entity registry and the link tables stay with their own callers —
what lands in this module is only the statements that touch `memory_units` (and,
on backends that keep one, the `observation_sources` junction that hangs off it).

Each function takes the live connection and Hindsight's ``fq_table`` resolver, so
it runs inside whatever transaction the caller already holds; ``ops`` is the
dialect ops object, which is what lets the same code serve the PG (native array)
and Oracle (junction table) shapes of the observation→source relation.
