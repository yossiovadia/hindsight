"""Extension interface for the *memories* slice of storage.

`memory_units` and the link tables around it (`memory_links`, `unit_entities`)
are the one part of the schema that is a search index as much as a table: every
recall arm — semantic, BM25, graph, temporal — is a query over them. This module
carves that slice out from behind the raw SQL so a different engine can own it,
without touching how documents, chunks, banks, operations or the entity registry
are stored.

The default :class:`~hindsight_api.engine.memories.postgres.PostgresMemories`
keeps everything exactly where it has always been: rows in `memory_units`, links
in `memory_links` and `unit_entities`, retrieval as SQL. It is what runs unless
an extension is configured, and it is the implementation the test suite
exercises.

An alternative implementation is loaded like any other Hindsight extension::

    HINDSIGHT_API_MEMORIES_EXTENSION=mypackage.memories:MyMemories
    HINDSIGHT_API_MEMORIES_SOME_SETTING=value

Such an implementation is the **sole store** for memories: no memory- or
link-shaped row reaches Postgres at all. Unit ids are minted by
:meth:`MemoriesExtension.allocate_unit_ids` rather than by an INSERT's RETURNING
clause, facts carry their entity ids and causal edges inline instead of becoming
join rows, and recall results come back fully populated with no Postgres
hydration. Everything else — documents, chunks, banks, the `entities` registry —
stays in Postgres either way.

Every operation the engine needs is a method here, so no call site branches on
which implementation is installed. Where the two differ, they differ by what the
method does: the Postgres implementation writes join rows and reprocesses links;
one that owns the store no-ops those passes and does its own thing.
